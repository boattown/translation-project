How to run the notebook:

The notebook runs on MLT gpu.
The pre-processed data is saved in train.csv, val.csv and test.csv.
The function get_data in Part 1 - Data preparation opens these files and creates train, val and test iteratros.
The saved models were too large to inlcude but can be trained again by running the cells in Part 2 - Building and training the model.
